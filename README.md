# Plotly Visualization Preference


 - `plotly_cheatsheet.pdf`: a collection of Plotly visualization preferences.
 - `vis_guide.md`: a markdown file that serves as a guide for LLMs to generate visualizations using Plotly.

You can use `vis_guide.md` in two ways:

1. Copy the content of the file to `.cursorrules`. This will provide visualization context for LLMs without the need to manually instruct it every session. 
2. Tag the file with `@vis_guide.md` in your prompt. This will provide the LLM with the context of the file for that specific session. This is outlined in the example below.


*Note*: edit the file to customize it for your specific needs and preferences, for example the *Limitations* section contains hard-coded values that you may want to change.

## Sample Prompt

```
Write a Python script to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset (`data/train.csv`).  

 - The target variable is `Survived`.
 - The EDA should be **visualization-heavy**: generate as many meaningful plots as possible to help understand relationships between features and the target variable.
 - Each plot should be saved to a dedicated `plots/` folder (create it if it doesn't exist).
 - The script should follow the structure and recommendations of @vis_guide.md
 - Include univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations where appropriate.
 - Include print statements summarizing insights after each plot.
 ```

 ## Outputs

   * `eda.py`: Python script that performs basic visual EDA on the Titanic dataset.
   * `plots/`: Directory containing all the plots generated by the script.

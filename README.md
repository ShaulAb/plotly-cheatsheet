# Plotly Visualization Preference


 - `plotly_cheatsheet.pdf`: a collection of Plotly visualization preferences.
 - `vis_guide.md`: a markdown file that serves as a guide for LLMs to generate visualizations using Plotly.

The content of `vis_guide.md` be copied into the `.cursorrules` files to provide visualization context for LLMs without the need to manually instruct it every session.
Edit the file to customize it for your specific needs and preferences, note that in the *restrictions* section, there are hard-coded values that you may want to change.

## Sample Prompt

"""
Write a Python script to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset (`data/train.csv`).  

 - The target variable is `Survived`.
 - The EDA should be **visualization-heavy**: generate as many meaningful plots as possible to help understand relationships between features and the target variable.
 - Each plot should be saved to a dedicated `plots/` folder (create it if it doesn't exist).
 - The script should follow the structure and recommendations of @vis_guide.md
 - Include univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations where appropriate.
 - Include print statements summarizing insights after each plot.
 """


 ## Outputs

   * `eda.py`: Python script that performs basic visual EDA on the Titanic dataset.
   * `plots/`: Directory containing all the plots generated by the script.
